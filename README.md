The code was written to process the output file from MiXCR (Dmitriy A. Bolotin, Stanislav Poslavsky, Igor Mitrophanov, Mikhail Shugay, Ilgar Z. Mamedov, Ekaterina V. Putintseva, and Dmitriy M. Chudakov. "MiXCR: software for comprehensive adaptive immunity profiling." Nature methods 12, no. 5 (2015): 380-381.)
